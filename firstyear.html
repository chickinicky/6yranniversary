    <h1>The Beginning of Our Story!!!</h1>
    <p>I'll never forget the first time I saw you at the STEP pool party. 
    Katherine had told me to keep an eye out for you but you really took my breathe away 
    when you stepped into the room &#128521;</p>

    <h2>Night Out in Oakland</h2>
    <p>This was the night when our relationship took a steamy turn &#128563; I loved dancing
         the night away with you and can't wait to have fun dancing with our family members and friends 
        at our wedding!</p>

    <p>I wish had a photo from our first picnic to include too since it was an important moment at the start of our 
        relationship! &#128584; 
    </p>    

    <h2>Ice Skating in Palo Alto!</h2>
    <p>I'll never forget how much fun we had ice skating in Palo Alto! I love how you were comfortable
     stepping out of your comfort zone with me! Can't belive that I was the one to fall on the ice that
    day &#128514; </p>

    <h2>Recuerdo Boy!!! &#128518;</h2>
    <p>Going to my cousin's wedding was a blast! I loved introducing you to so many of my family members and 
        getting to dance the night away with you once again &#128521; Can't believe we'll be celebrating our own 
        wedding in under a year &#128561;
    </p>

    <h2>My Princess' Graduation &#10084;</h2>
    <p>I couldn't think of a better way to cap off the first year of our relationship! I loved getting to meet your 
        family &#128525; I'll never forget how proud I felt seeing you during graduation weekend and will
        always admire your determination as you went through STEP and student teaching! &#128536;
