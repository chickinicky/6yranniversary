<h1>Can You Believe It's Been 6?!!!</h1>
<p>Now it's time to take a look at some of the fun moments in the sixth year of our relationship!!!</p>

<h2>Birthday Celebrations!!!</h2>
<p>The birthday celebrations this past year were incredible! We were able to go back to the Blue Plate to have some
    of that fluffy mashed potatoes and even got a look at the SF skyline from Twin Peaks at night! We also got a chance
    to add another escape room to our resume with so many of our friends!

<h2>Mar de Turks and Caicos!</h2>
<p>Going to Turks and Caicos was incredible! I had so much fun taking LOTO to the beach and relaxing with the two of you!
    I'll also never forget the love buggy ride with Marvelous Marvin! The beaches at Turks and Caicos were definitely 
    some of the most beatiful I've ever seen!

<h2>San Felipe Adventure!</h2>
<p> The San Felipe adventure we had this year with my friends was a blast! I loved signing karaoke together, relaxing
    at the beach, and getting to dance at the bar in the malecon!

<h2>Sumimazen!!!</h2>
<p>Visiting Japan has been one of my favorite vacations! Getting to see cherry blossoms fall from the trees was an amazing
    experience and I can see why Bad Bunny chose to have that in one of his music videos! The life and food at the different
    prefectures in Tokyo was incredible! Will never forget those juicy soup dumplings! Going to the ryokan in Kyoto
    was an elightening cultural experience that let us sleep in traditional Japanese beds and eat some really tasty 
    traditional Japanese dishes! Lastly, I can't forget to give a shout-out to my good friend Totoro!!!!

<h2>MIAMI!!! Quiero que regreses a mi!</h2>
<p>I had an amazing time in Miami! Can't believe we fell asleep at the beach and I sure am glad no one took my wallet lol
    I had a great time at the drag bar as evidenced by the picture below! I'll never forget our first reggaeton festival
    and how awesome it felt to be so close to Nicky Jam and J Balvin!
