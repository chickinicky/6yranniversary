    going to so many different countries and sharing some of the things you remembered so fondly from
    your previous adventures with Abby.

<h2>Trip to Mystery Location!</h2>
<p>Going to Portland was an awesome adventure! It was a great idea to try out PackUp + Go!!! I'll never forget
    all the yummy food we tried on that trip! It was also crazy going up the waterfall trail with all
    of the snow and ice in the area! Good thing we didn't fall! &#128584;

<h2>Picnic Finally Makes an Appearance!</h2>
<p>Picnics have marked special occations throughout our relationship, from changing the tone of our relationship to 
    being more romantic to celebrating birthdays &#128521; I hope that you always remember the special picnics that
    we've shared &#128525;

<h2>First Time Together at Tahoe!!!</h2>
<p>Going to Tahoe for the first was an unforgettable experience. From riding our bikes down the different beaches to
    checking out eagle falls, our first trip to Tahoe will always have a special place in my heart &#10084; As we'll see
    as we move through the rest of the years of our relationship, Tahoe has continued to be a special place for us &#128527;
